I love to experience new places, new foods and meet new people.   Having lived in Brazil, Japan, Thailand and many years here in the United States I appreciate diverse viewpoints and customs.    Getting helpful insight from friendly locals makes any stay so much richer.

For my day job, I develop multifamily housing.   I am interested in creating living solutions that allow residents to pursue their passions and interests while having a smaller environmental footprint.    To that end, I am involved in a startup that uses architectural robotics to create transformable spaces.

As a father of five, I am a family man.   I appreciate the challenges and joys of travelling with family.    My wife and I took our children down the Silk Road on a 3 week hand carry only trip.   Getting good local advice can be critical to making a stay pleasant and rewarding for every member of the family.

Enjoy the beautiful views of the Charles River along the way!<br /><br />Nearby Porter Square offers a variety of shops including a supermarket, drug store, toy shop, a gift shop that sells wares made by local artists, and a well-visited independent book store (with great coffee!) that frequently hosts talks by notable authors. There's even a new Target a short walk away.

This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.
